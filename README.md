# MachineLearning-KnowledgeBase
*This is a collaborative project of Falk Heuer, Viviane Kakerbeck, Johannes Schrumpf and Justine Winkler.*

We formed a poductive and self-organized learning group in which we deepen each others knowledge about various areas of machine learning
by telling each other about our own areas of expertise. This is done in weekly (skype)meetings in which we each present a topic and
upload a short summary about this topic.

Additionally we realize different small projects together which will be uploaded in different git repositories.

We hope that also others can profit from this knowledge base and our projects. We are also open for new ideas and suggestions!
